User is asked how many characters would you like your password to contain (must be more than 9 and less than 128)
    QUESTIONS TO ASK:
        1. What if they type out "nine" or use a number? Will your code be able to tell?
            a. You could use an if(typeof) method to see if its a number, if it is not a number you can ask for numbers only.
            b. You could incorporate both strings and numbers, but for strings you would need to figure out how to read every number.
        2. How can we confirm the number of characters is greater than 9 and less than 128?
            a. A simple if statement for if its greater or less than 9 or 128.
        3. How will this be asked?
            a. You can use a prompt to ask this questions
            b. Is there a way to limit to only numbers? (RESEARCH)
        4. Where will you store the answer?
            a. we can store it inside a variable that will be called later in a for loop to create the password.

    Questions to ask:
        1. How will you ask the User
            a. Confirm()

            a. Put inside of a boolean true or false statement that will connect to an if statement
        2. If no, how will you keep it out of the result
            a. Have an if statement that connects to a charset, if it comes false we skip the charset
        3. If yes, how will you include it in the result
            a. Have an if statement that connects to a charset, if it comes false we add the charset to an ending array (Concat()?)

How is the password generated?
    1. What methods would you use?
    2. How would you implement the characters being used?
